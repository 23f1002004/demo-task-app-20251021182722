# Simple HTML/CSS/JS Demo App

This repository contains a basic, three-file frontend demonstration showcasing fundamental web development principles: structure (`index.html`), presentation (`styles.css`), and interactivity (`script.js`).

## Structure

The application implements a simple click counter that dynamically updates both a click total and a motivational message based on the current count.

## Usage

1. Ensure all three files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`) are saved in the same directory.
2. Open `index.html` using any modern web browser.
3. Click the "Start Interaction" button to trigger the JavaScript functionality.
